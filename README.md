# ai4medicine-Ceres: Predictive Presymptomatic Disease Detection based on Wearable Data
My personal repository based on improving and continuing our work in the TUM.ai makeathon 2022. The original repo where we worked in the 48h could be found [here](https://github.com/JamisonProctor/Team-Ceres). I forked the repos that we based our work on which are also linked below. The novel idea of our team was to combine the finite state machine approach and deep learning based approach of the original authors in an ensamble of the studies cited in the sources.

## Challenge & Intro
The challenge was supported and set by the company [ai4medicine](https://ai4medicine.com/). They provided us with references to the raw data and provided evaluation code which can be found in [this forked repo](https://github.com/altaykacan/ai4medicine-Ceres-eval-templates).
